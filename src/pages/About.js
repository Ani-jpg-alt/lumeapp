                My name is <strong>Langelihle Mpanza</strong>, and I'm a 25-year-old woman who's always carried a deep love for fashion. 
                Somewhere along the way, life happened - and I lost touch with that passion. But dreams have a beautiful way of calling us back, louder and stronger than before.
              </p>
              
              <p style={{marginBottom: '1.5rem'}}>
                It's always been my dream to work with iconic fashion brands, especially those that celebrate and empower women through trend-forward, bold, and stylish pieces. 
                I saw a gap - not just in the market, but in my own heart - and decided it was time to fill it.

              <p style={{marginBottom: '1.5rem'}}>
                So here I am, turning passion into purpose, with the launch of my very own online boutique: <strong style={{color: '#000000'}}>Lume by Langelihle</strong>.
              </p>
              
              <p style={{marginBottom: '1.5rem'}}>
                <strong>Lume is all about confidence, energy, and glow.</strong> We're kicking things off with hot summer essentials and gym wear — curated for the modern woman who knows what she wants and owns her shine. From beach days to gym slays, this is for YOU.
              </p>
              
              <p style={{marginBottom: '1.5rem'}}>
                It's summer, and we're taking it into our own hands.
              </p>
              
              <p style={{marginBottom: '1.5rem'}}>
                The official launch is coming very soon — and trust me, you don't want to miss the drop!
